<h2>📖 Story Behind the Project</h2>

<p>
Every journey begins with a first step — and this project was mine.  
<b>HR Data Analytics</b> was my introduction to the world of <b>Business Intelligence</b> and <b>data storytelling</b>.  
</p>

<p>
It started with curiosity:  
<i>How do companies understand their people?  
How do they measure performance, retention, and hiring trends?</i>  
</p>

<p>
Guided by <b>Codebasics</b>, I decided to explore the hidden story within HR datasets.  
With <b>Power BI</b> as my canvas, I learned to transform raw employee records into insights that could help organizations make meaningful decisions.
This experience became the foundation of my data analytics journey.

<h2>✅ What I Discovered</h2>

<p>
As I explored the data, I found patterns that revealed how companies grow, retain talent, and structure their workforce.  
Each visualization felt like uncovering a new chapter of the story:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>📊 Workforce composition across departments</li>
  <li>♻️ Hiring and attrition trends</li>
  <li>⏳ Experience and age group distributions</li>
  <li>📅 Employment type breakdown</li>
</ul>

<p>
It was fascinating to see how numbers slowly turned into insights — helping HR teams make informed decisions about their people.

<h2>🎨 The Dashboard Journey</h2>

<p>
Building the dashboard was like painting with data.  
I learned how thoughtful design can help make analytics more approachable:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>🎛 User-friendly structure</li>
  <li>📊 Clear visual hierarchy</li>
  <li>🔎 Focus on actionable insights</li>
  <li>📌 Consistent themes and formatting</li>
